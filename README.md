# Errand Mapper

The main idea of this project is to accept a list of errands the user wants to complete. Based on the categories of the errands, the prevailing weather conditions and a few other factors the app will plan the shortest trip for the user to complete all the errands

v1.py is the first version of this app which uses the Google Maps API and Open Weather API and tells you the weather condition at two given locations. This will eventually be used to check the weather conditions at each location the user needs to go to complete the errand and on an overall level advice the user whether to make this trip right now or not.
